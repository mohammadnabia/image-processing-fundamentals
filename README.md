# image-processing-fundamentals  
We will get acquainted with the fundamental and essential things in image processing in this repository. We will learn how to implement basic algorithms and functions and follow the necessary items in image processing.

## List of items that will be implemented.
- [x] Histogram equalization
- [x] Intensity transformations
- [x] Defining the convolution function with a selectable kernel for use in filtering images & spatial filtering
- [x] Calculating the gradient and  gradient orientation of an image
