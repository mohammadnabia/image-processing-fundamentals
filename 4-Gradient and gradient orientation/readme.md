# Gradient & Gradient orientaion using python in google colab

This repository provides code examples and a tutorial for computing gradients and gradient orientations of images using Python in Google Colab. Gradients are widely used in image processing and computer vision tasks such as edge detection, feature extraction, and object recognition. The examples and explanations provided here will help you understand the concept of gradients and gradient orientation and implement them effectively in your own projects.

## Introduction

Gradients provide valuable information about the intensity variations and spatial changes within an image. They represent the magnitude and direction of changes in pixel values, allowing us to identify edges and boundaries between different objects or regions. Gradient orientation, in particular, helps in understanding the orientation or direction of these changes, which can be useful for various image analysis tasks.

This repository demonstrates how to compute gradients and gradient orientations of images using Python in Google Colab. It provides code examples and a step-by-step tutorial to help you understand and implement gradient-based techniques in your own projects.

## Prerequisites

To follow the examples in this repository, you need the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
- Familiarity with image processing concepts.
- A Google account to access Google Colab or any other platforms that can open jupyter notebook.

## Examples
There are many methods to calculate the gradient and gradient orientation of an image you can use the Sobel Operator, Scharr Operator, or the Prewitt Operator. In this implementation, we have used the Sobel operator to calculate the result.
