# Histogram equalization using python in google colab


Have you ever wanted to increase the quality of your image or improve the contrast of your desired photo? 
In this repository, we will examine histogram equalization using Python programming language in the Google colab environment.
What is implemented in this repository is on black-and-white images. In fact, before starting to work with the photo, we single-channeled our picture, which means our photo is black and white, and we work only on the black and white channel. We removed the other Red, Green, and Blue channels.

| *The image on the left is our input and the image on the right is the output of our code.* |

## STEPS



- [x] Import cv2, numpy, matplotlib, urllib, cv2_imshow
- [x] Define your histogram function
- [x] Define cumulative summation of the data fucntion
- [x] Import or upload the image
- [x] Calculate the histogram of the input image
- [x] Calculate the cumulative sum of the input image
- [x] Acquire the value from the cumulative sum for every pixel in our image and set that as equalized image.
- [x] Compare the input image with the enhanced image
