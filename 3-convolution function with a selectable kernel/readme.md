# Convolution Function with Selectable Kernel for Image Filtering & Spatial Filtering using Python in Google Colab

This repository provides code examples and a tutorial for performing image filtering and spatial filtering using a convolution function with a selectable kernel in Python on Google Colab. The examples and explanations provided here will help you understand the concept of convolution and implement various spatial filtering techniques effectively in your own image processing projects.

## Introduction
Convolution is a fundamental operation in image processing, used for tasks such as image filtering and feature extraction. It involves sliding a kernel (also known as a filter or mask) over an image and performing element-wise multiplication and summation operations to obtain a new output image. Spatial filtering is a common application of convolution, where different kernel configurations can produce various effects like blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more.

This repository provides a convolution function with a selectable kernel that allows you to perform image filtering and spatial filtering using Python in Google Colab. It covers various techniques and provides code examples to help you understand and implement different filters in your own projects.

## Prerequisites

To follow the examples in this repository, you need the following prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
* Familiarity with image processing concepts.
* A Google account to access Google Colab.

## Examples

- The convolution function with a selectable kernel
```python
def convolution1(image, kernel):
  pixels = []
  for i in range(image.shape[0]):
    for j in range(image.shape[1]):
      pixels.append(image[i,j]);

  pixels = np.array(pixels).reshape(image.shape[0],image.shape[1]);

  pixels = np.insert(pixels , [0,image.shape[0]] , np.zeros(len(pixels[0])) , axis = 0);
  pixels = np.insert(pixels , [0,image.shape[1]] , np.zeros((len(pixels[:, 0]) ,1)) , axis = 1);

  convoluted_matrix = [];
  for i in range(1,image.shape[0]):
    for j in range(1,image.shape[1]):
     temp = pixels[i:i+3 , j:j+3]
     product = np.multiply(temp,kernel)
     convoluted_matrix.append(sum(sum(product)));

  convoluted_matrix = np.array(convoluted_matrix).reshape(image.shape[0]-1,image.shape[1]-1);

  return(convoluted_matrix)
```
