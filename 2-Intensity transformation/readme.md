# Intensity transformation using python in google colab
This repository provides code examples and a tutorial for performing intensity transformation operations using Python in Google Colab. Intensity transformation refers to the manipulation of pixel intensity values in an image to enhance or modify its appearance. The examples and explanations provided here will help you understand the concept and implement intensity transformation techniques in your own projects.

## Introduction
Intensity transformation plays a vital role in image processing, computer vision, and various other domains. It involves modifying the pixel values of an image to achieve desired effects such as contrast enhancement, brightness adjustment, gamma correction, and more. By manipulating the intensity values, you can improve the visual quality of images and extract useful information.

This repository demonstrates how to perform intensity transformation operations using Python in Google Colab. It covers various techniques and provides code examples to help you understand and implement these transformations effectively.

## Prerequisites
To follow the examples in this repository, you need the following prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
Familiarity with image processing concepts.
A Google account to access Google Colab.

## Examples
The repository includes several examples of intensity transformation techniques. Here are a few highlights:
